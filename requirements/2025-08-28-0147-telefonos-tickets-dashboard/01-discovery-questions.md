# Discovery Questions - TELEFONOS_TICKETS Dashboard

**Phase 2: Context Discovery Questions**

These questions help understand the problem space and user requirements for the TELEFONOS_TICKETS dashboard feature.

## Q1: Will users need to export or download data from this dashboard?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (based on existing `/api/report/download` endpoint and Excel export functionality in current codebase)

**Why this default:** The existing codebase has established patterns for data export via `/api/report/route.ts` that generates downloadable Excel files. This suggests users frequently need to export data for further analysis or reporting.

## Q2: Should the dashboard display real-time data that updates automatically?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (based on existing auto-refresh patterns in `use-base-data.ts` with 15-minute intervals)

**Why this default:** The current IMEI dashboard uses auto-refresh functionality, indicating users expect up-to-date information without manual refreshes for operational dashboards.

## Q3: Will users need to filter data beyond just date ranges?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (based on complex filtering patterns in `imei-table.tsx` with search, type filters, and pagination)

**Why this default:** The existing dashboard components show sophisticated filtering by search terms, status types, and pagination, suggesting users require granular data filtering capabilities.

## Q4: Should this dashboard follow the same visual design patterns as the existing IMEI table dashboard?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintains design consistency across the Mesa de Ayuda Hub application)

**Why this default:** The app has established design patterns using Untitled UI components, consistent navigation, and similar table layouts. Maintaining visual consistency improves user experience.

## Q5: Will multiple user types or roles access this dashboard with different permission levels?
**Default if unknown:** No (based on current simple authentication patterns without role-based restrictions)

**Why this default:** The existing codebase doesn't show complex role-based access controls or different views based on user types, suggesting a simpler access model is currently in use.
