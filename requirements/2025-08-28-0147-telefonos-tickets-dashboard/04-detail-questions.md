# Expert Detail Questions - TELEFONOS_TICKETS Dashboard

**Phase 4: Expert Requirements Questions**

Based on deep codebase analysis, these questions clarify expected system behavior from a senior developer perspective who understands the technical implementation details:

## Q6: Should we extend the existing Google Sheets API pattern in `src/lib/sheets.ts` to handle TELEFONOS_TICKETS data with the same authentication and error handling?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintains architectural consistency with existing `getBaseSheetData()` and `getStockSheetData()` functions)

**Why this default:** The current codebase has a well-established pattern in `sheets.ts` with standardized authentication via Service Account, consistent error handling, and data conversion functions. Adding `getTelefonosTicketsSheetData()` would follow the exact same pattern used for BASE and STOCK sheets.

## Q7: Will the dashboard require real-time analytics calculations (like projections and stock analysis from claude.md) or should it display raw ticket data with basic filtering?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (based on the comprehensive analysis requirements described in claude.md including projections, stock integration, and budget calculations)

**Why this default:** The claude.md file describes complex analytics including demand projections, stock netting, budget calculations, and distribuidora analysis. This suggests users need processed analytics, not just raw table data.

## Q8: Should we use the existing table patterns from `src/components/dashboard/imei-table.tsx` with pagination and optimistic updates, or create a simpler read-only table?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (extend existing table patterns but make read-only since these are historical tickets)

**Why this default:** The existing `imei-table.tsx` has sophisticated filtering, search, pagination (50 items), and sort functionality that users are already familiar with. However, ticket data is typically historical and read-only, so we'd remove the edit/update functionality.

## Q9: Based on the existing `/api/report/download` pattern that generates Excel files, should the PDF export follow the same async download pattern with file generation?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintains consistency with existing download functionality and handles large reports efficiently)

**Why this default:** The current `/api/report/route.ts` generates Excel files as downloadable responses. PDF generation with React-PDF should follow the same pattern for consistency and to handle potentially large reports with multiple pages and charts.

## Q10: Should we add Recharts as a dependency for visualizations, following the pattern of other added libraries like `@untitledui/icons` and `googleapis`?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (based on chart requirements in claude.md and existing pattern of adding specialized libraries to package.json)

**Why this default:** The claude.md specification mentions multiple chart types (barras, donut, l√≠neas, pie) for the dashboard. The codebase already includes specialized libraries for icons and Google Sheets integration, indicating the project is comfortable adding focused dependencies for specific functionality.
