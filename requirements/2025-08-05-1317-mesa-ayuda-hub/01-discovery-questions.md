# Discovery Questions - Mesa de Ayuda Hub

**Generated:** 2025-08-05 13:17  
**Phase:** Discovery (2/5)

These questions help understand the core problem space and user workflows for the Mesa de Ayuda Hub.

## Q1: Will users need to access this application on mobile devices?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (field support teams often work on mobile devices)

**Reasoning:** Mesa de Ayuda teams may need to check device status, respond to tickets, or view stock information while away from their desks or when visiting remote locations.

## Q2: Should the application work offline or require constant internet connectivity?
**Default if unknown:** No (requires real-time data from Google Sheets)

**Reasoning:** Since the core functionality depends on pulling live data from Google Sheets and providing real-time updates, offline functionality would be limited. However, some cached data viewing might be beneficial.

## Q3: Will this application handle sensitive customer information (phone numbers, personal data)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (contains phone numbers and device tracking data)

**Reasoning:** Based on context.md, the system tracks phone numbers, IMEI devices, and user connection patterns, which are considered sensitive information requiring proper security measures.

## Q4: Do users currently have an existing workflow or system for managing these IMEI devices?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (manual Google Sheets management)

**Reasoning:** The context indicates they're currently using manual Google Sheets processes for IMEI tracking, which this system aims to automate and improve.

## Q5: Will multiple teams or departments need different access levels or views of the data?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (different roles have different needs)

**Reasoning:** Context mentions Mesa de Ayuda team, remote branch offices (EDEN), and management each having different information needs - operations vs. reporting vs. stock visibility.

**Next Step:** Ask each question individually and record answers before proceeding to Phase 3.
